                    Computer
                    Science</a>
                by John Zelle
            </strong>
            is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a
            fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of
            computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python.

                by Luciano Ramalho
            </strong>
            will teach you how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most
            neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python's core language features and libraries,
            and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.

                    Programming</a>
                by Jason R. Briggs
            </strong>
            brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient
            Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious)
            example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are
            defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the
            lighter side.
