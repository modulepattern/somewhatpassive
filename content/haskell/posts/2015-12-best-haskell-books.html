            </strong>
            is an easy-to-use, fast-moving tutorial introduces you to functional programming with Haskell. You'll learn
            how to use Haskell in a variety of practical ways, from short scripts to large and demanding applications.
            Real World Haskell takes you through the basics of functional programming at a brisk pace, and then helps
            you increase your understanding of Haskell in real-world issues like I/O, performance, dealing with data,
            concurrency, and more as you move through each chapter.

                by Graham Hutton
            </strong>
            is ideal for beginners: it requires no previous programming experience and all concepts are explained from
            first principles via carefully chosen examples. Each chapter includes exercises that range from the
            straightforward to extended projects, plus suggestions for further reading on more advanced topics.

                    Haskell</a>
                by Simon Marlow
            </strong>
            is a hands-on book shows you how to use the languages many APIs and frameworks for writing both parallel
            and concurrent programs. Youll learn how parallelism exploits multicore processors to speed up
            computation-heavy programs, and how concurrency enables you to write programs with threads for multiple
            interactions.

                by Alejandro Serrano Mena
            </strong>
            provides a broad-based introduction to the Haskell language, its libraries and environment, and to the
            functional programming paradigm that is fast growing in importance in the software industry. The book takes
            a project-based approach to learning the language that is unified around the building of a web-based
            storefront. Excellent coverage is given to the Haskell ecosystem and supporting tools.
