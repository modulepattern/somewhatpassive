    <h3>Step 3: Council of 13 wise sages</h3>

    <p>There are rumors that the wise sage Odersky from time-to-time reveals great secrets to seekers of the truth. You
        head over to Coursera and register for
        an
        upcoming initiation into Functional Programming Principles in Scala</p>

    <p>Other than the venerable Odersky, you learn of Spoon, Venners, Pollak, Subramaniam, Payne, Wampler, Loverdos,
        Syropoulos, Braun, Piepmeyer, Suereth,
